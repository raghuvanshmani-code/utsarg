/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Student Society App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure data access by enforcing strict ownership for user-specific data
 * and leveraging custom claims for administrative roles. It avoids complex queries in the rules by
 * assuming a degree of client-side data validation, focusing on authorization. Data shape validation is relaxed to prioritize rapid iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profiles, accessible only to the owning user and admins.
 * - `/society/meta`: Public metadata about the society.
 * - `/clubs/{clubId}`: Club data, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/volunteers/{volunteerId}`: Volunteer profiles, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/members/{memberId}`: Member profiles, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Event data, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/gallery/{galleryId}`: Gallery items, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/funds/accounting/transactions/{transactionId}`: Financial transaction logs, readable only by admins.
 * - `/philanthropy/{activityId}`: Philanthropy activity records, publicly readable, writable by admins only.
 * - `/adminLogs/{logId}`: Logs of admin activity, readable only by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private, accessible only to the user themselves and admins.
 * - Society metadata is public.
 * - Other top-level collections are publicly readable, but writable only by admins.
 * - No user listing is allowed for `users` collection.
 * - Admin status is determined by a custom claim on the user's auth token.
