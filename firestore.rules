/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 *              allows public read access to club, event, gallery, and philanthropy data,
 *              and restricts write access to owners or authorized users. The society
 *              metadata document is read-only for all users but cannot be modified through the client.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 *  - /society/meta: Society-wide metadata.
 *  - /clubs/{clubId}: Information about individual clubs.
 *  - /volunteers/{volunteerId}: Volunteer profiles.
 *  - /members/{memberId}: General member profiles.
 *  - /events/{eventId}: Club event details.
 *  - /gallery/{galleryId}: Media items for the gallery.
 *  - /funds/accounting/transactions/{transactionId}: Financial transactions.
 *  - /philanthropy/{activityId}: Philanthropic activity records.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User profiles are strictly owned by the user with matching UID.
 *  - The /society/meta document is publicly readable, but not writable through the client.
 *  - Public read access to clubs, events, gallery items and philanthropy activities is granted for all users.
 *  - Write access to clubs, events, gallery items and philanthropy activities is restricted to authenticated users.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *  - For public read collections, documents should contain an `ownerId` or `authorId` field
 *    to enable owner-only writes.  However, these are not yet implemented (see TODOs).
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 *  - Public vs. private data is managed through different top-level collections
 *    (e.g., user profiles in `/users/{userId}` vs. public gallery items in `/gallery/{galleryId}`).
