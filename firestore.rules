/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules
 * @version 2
 *
 * @description This ruleset prioritizes ease of data access for prototyping purposes.
 * All reads and writes are currently permitted, which allows for rapid iteration
 * and development without strict authorization checks.
 *
 * @security-warning THIS RULES SET IS INSECURE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.
 * ALL READS AND WRITES ARE OPEN TO ALL USERS. THIS IS INTENDED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING ONLY.
 *
 * @next-steps Before deploying to production, replace `allow read, write: if true;`
 * with fine-grained authorization logic based on user roles and data ownership.
 * Consider implementing the following:
 *   - User authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication.
 *   - Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
 *   - Data validation to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious input.
